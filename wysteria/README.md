# Wysteria

[Wysteria](https://bitbucket.org/aseemr/wysteria/wiki/Home) implements a novel high-level functional programming language. It is guaranteed to meet the ideal MPC definition: that the distributed secure computation produces the same output as a single trusted party would. Wysteria uses a Boolean-circuit based GMW protocol implementation and supports an arbitary number of computation parties; the software contribution includes a front-end language specification, a type checker, and a run-time interpreter.

Wysteria was developed by Aseem Rastogi, Matthew Hammer, and Michael Hicks at the [Programming Languages group](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/) at the University of Maryland.

Our recommendation: Wysteria's limited support for complex data types, current lack of development, and outdated back-end circuit parser means that we do not recommend it for complex or efficient applications. On the other hand, Wysteria is the only compiler we examined that verifies the equivalence between the underlying MPC and the monolithic program, and the only compiler that uses a functional-style programming language. 
We recommend Wysteria's type-based correctness and security guarantees as a model for future framework developers.

## Docker setup

Create a Docker image. This will take a few minutes. You only have to do this once.
```
$ docker build -t wysteria .
```
Spin up a Docker container from the image.
```
$ docker run -it --rm wysteria
```
Please note that any changes you make in the container are not persistent.

## Architecture
A Wysteria program is completely self-contained; both secure and insecure code
is written in the Wysteria language. A program is run in two steps:

1. Set up servers for each party. These servers are independent of the program being run, except that they must know how many parties are involved. The server binary is called `mpc.exe`.

2. Run a computation. This requires a program described in a `.wy` file. The program's secure blocks are compiled into circuits and computed. The executable that compiles secure blocks and runs the mixed-mode computation is called `wysteria`.

We've installed both these binaries in `/usr/bin`. 

The files `addresses.txt` and `princs.txt` must also be in the directory. They contain public information about the parties involved in the computation.

## Running examples

We were only able to write one of our sample programs, `mult3`. Participant input values are hardcoded. We've included several other examples in `~/source/examples/other`, including a partial, broken crosstabs implementation and an alternate implementation of the millionaire's problem.

We provide two scripts to aid in running a computation.
                                                                                    
The script `runtest.sh` will run an example starting separate screen tabs for three servers and clients. By default, this runs the millionaire's problem, but you can pass a different example as a parameter.
```
$ ./runtest.sh mult3.wy
Running test examples/mult3.wy
$ screen -r wysteria

# wysteria --i-am \!Charlie --gmw-port 9002 examples/mill.wy
typing the program under top
done with type checking the program
!Charlie output: [!Charlie:10]
# 
```
Press `ctrl-D` to cycle through the screens and see the output for each party and `ctrl-AD` to close all screens.

The script `cleanup.sh` will kill the running screen session and delete the numerous temp files created by the MPC computation.

## Modifying examples

Source code for these examples is in `wysteria/src/examples`. After editing an example, you can run the computation as above (via `./runtest.sh`) or you can try running a single Wysteria participant, which will type-check the program. Once it type-checks, you should run via `./runtest.sh`.
```
$ wysteria --i-am \!Alice --gmw-port 9000 examples/mytest.wy
typing the program under top
done with type checking the program
Fatal error: exception Unix.Unix_error(Unix.ECONNREFUSED, "connect", "")
```
